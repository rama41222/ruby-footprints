# Intro

This is my attempt to learn ruby on rails. I will be making sample apps by following tutorials. 


# Installation

### General commands
```
rvm list # List down the ruby versions
rvm use [version ] # Switch the ruby version
rails -v # Current rails version
```
### Generate rails project

```
rails _5.3.4_ new [project_name] # Generate new project
rails s # Run the project
rails c # Open the console 
rails s -p [port] # Run rails by specifying a port
```
